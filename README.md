# 🏁 Does Qualifying Really Matter? The Causal Impact of Advancing to Q2 and Q3 on Formula 1 Race Outcomes 🎯

Hi there! 👋

Welcome to my repo — bringing econometrics into the world of Formula 1! 🚦🏎️  
This project uses a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) to explore a question as old as F1 itself:  
Does qualifying performance on Saturday really impact a driver's race on Sunday?

- [`FinalDataSet.csv`](FinalDataSet.csv): The full dataset used for the analysis.
- [`0.DataExtraction.ipynb`](0.DataExtraction.ipynb): Jupyter notebook that collects and cleans the raw data using FastF1.
- [`1.Results.R`](1.Results.R): Runs the main RD estimates using the estimation equation for Q1 and Q2 transitions.
- [`2.RobustnessAnalysis.R`](2.RobustnessAnalysis.R): Performs robustness checks by varying bandwidths and cutoffs.

Thanks for checking out the project!  
If you’re into F1 and econometrics, you’re in the right place. 🧠📈🏎️
